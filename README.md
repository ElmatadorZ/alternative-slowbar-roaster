GCIS — Genesis Coffee Intelligence Standard

An Open AI Standard for Modeling the Coffee Ecosystem


---

Overview

GCIS (Genesis Coffee Intelligence Standard) is an open, model-agnostic AI standard for structuring, analyzing, and simulating the entire coffee ecosystem — from green bean physics to roast dynamics, extraction modeling, and sensory quantification.

GCIS is not a product.
It is not a SaaS tool.
It is not a proprietary framework.

It is a standard specification designed to be:

LLM-compatible

Schema-verifiable

Physics-grounded

Sensory-structured

Open and extensible


Any AI system can adopt GCIS to ensure structured reasoning, reproducible outputs, and ecosystem-level modeling consistency.

Why GCIS Exists

Coffee intelligence today is fragmented:

Sensory evaluation is subjective

Roast analysis lacks unified structure

Extraction modeling is tool-specific

Origin data is inconsistently represented

AI outputs vary wildly without schema control


GCIS provides a unified reasoning structure using:

First Principle modeling

System Thinking

Explicit schema validation

Falsifier-based reasoning (inspired by Genesis Protocol)



---

Core Layers

GCIS is built on five intelligence layers:

1. Bean Intelligence Layer

Structured modeling of:

Origin

Variety

Process

Moisture

Density

RGB-based roast stage interpretation



---

2. Roast Physics Layer

Modeling:

Heat transfer dynamics

Development ratio logic

Crack phase transitions

Roast energy mapping



---

3. Extraction Dynamics Layer

Structured reasoning for:

Grind distribution

Flow resistance

Pressure mapping

Turbulence modeling

Tool-specific simulation



---

4. Sensory Quantification Layer

Reducing sensory variability through:

Aroma fingerprint modeling

Defect classification

Structured tasting schema

Variance analysis



---

5. Ecosystem Intelligence Layer

System-level modeling of:

Traceability

Value chain logic

Sustainability metrics

Market simulation



---

Design Principles

GCIS follows these rules:

1. Separate facts, assumptions, and unknowns


2. Use falsifiers before conclusions


3. Validate outputs against explicit schema


4. Refuse when evidence is insufficient


5. Model using physics before metaphor




---

What GCIS Is Not

Not a roast profile app

Not a cupping scoring sheet

Not a commercial SaaS

Not a proprietary AI model


GCIS is closer to:

JSON Schema

HTTP specification

ISO modeling standard


It defines structure — not ownership.


---

Who Should Use GCIS

Specialty coffee roasters

Coffee tech startups

AI model developers

Food science researchers

QC teams

RTD manufacturers

Freeze-dried producers

Equipment manufacturers



---

How to Use with Any LLM

You can instruct any LLM:

> “Analyze this coffee using GCIS Bean + Roast + Extraction schema.
Separate facts, assumptions, unknowns.
Generate falsifiers.
Validate against GCIS_CORE_STANDARD.”



If the model follows structured output, it is GCIS-compatible.

Refusal over hallucination

Falsifier-first logic

Schema validation


Genesis Protocol governs reasoning integrity.
GCIS governs coffee ecosystem modeling.
