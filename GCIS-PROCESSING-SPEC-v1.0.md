GCIS – Post-Harvest Processing Specification v1.0
1. Purpose
Standardize coffee processing terminology into measurable variables.
Eliminate vague terms like:
“Clean”
“Funky”
“Wild”
Replace with structured fermentation data.
2. Processing Categories
Washed
Honey
Natural
Anaerobic
Carbonic Maceration
Extended Fermentation
Experimental Hybrid
3. Fermentation Variables
Mandatory structured inputs:
Fermentation Type (aerobic / anaerobic / hybrid)
Duration (hours)
Temperature (°C)
pH Range
Brix Before & After
Microbial Intent (wild / selected strain)
Oxygen Exposure Level
4. Drying Phase Variables
Drying Method (sun / raised bed / mechanical)
Average Temperature
Humidity Range
Total Drying Time
Turning Frequency
5. Processing Signature Model
Each lot generates:
Coffee Processing Signature (CPS)
CPS = Structured fingerprint combining:
Fermentation + Drying + Origin + Variety
6. Freshness & Stability Model
Include:
Moisture %
Water Activity
Storage Conditions
Packaging Type
Time Since Milling
7. AI Compatibility Clause
AI must:
Separate fact vs assumption
Provide uncertainty range
Flag insufficient data
Avoid romantic marketing language
